        <ol>
          <li><span class="highlight">Prepare the Dough:</span> In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, yeast, sugar, and salt. Gradually add warm water and knead until a smooth dough forms.</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Let the Dough Rise:</span> Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, usually about 1 hour.</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Shape the Buns:</span> Punch down the risen dough and divide it into equal-sized portions. Shape each portion into a round bun and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Second Rise:</span> Cover the buns with a kitchen towel and let them rise for another 30 minutes to an hour until they double in size again.</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Bake:</span>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush the buns with egg wash (optional) and bake for 15-20 minutes or until they turn golden brown.</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Cool and Enjoy:</span> Allow the buns to cool on a wire rack before serving. Enjoy them warm or store them in an airtight container for later.</li>
