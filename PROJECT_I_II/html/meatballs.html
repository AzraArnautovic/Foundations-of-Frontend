        <ol>
          <li><span class="highlight">Prepare the Meatballs:</span> In a large bowl, mix together ground beef, breadcrumbs, egg, onion, salt, pepper, and allspice until well combined. Shape the mixture into small meatballs.</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Cook the Meatballs:</span> In a skillet over medium heat, add oil and brown the meatballs on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Once browned, remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.</li>
          <li><span class="highlight">Make the Sauce:</span> In the same skillet, melt butter and whisk in flour to create a roux. Gradually pour in beef broth and heavy cream, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
